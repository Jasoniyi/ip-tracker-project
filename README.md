## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learn't how to use 'calc()' in css and also used this project to practice calling apis and using async await with axios.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    min-height: calc(100vh - 15em);
```

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19186428/refresh-leaflet-map-map-container-is-already-initialized) - This helped me for using the Map when my Map wasn't showing and it kept giving this error 'refresh leaflet map: map container is already initialized'.
